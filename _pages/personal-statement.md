  <summary>Introduction</summary>
<p>
  <br>
I am a Product Engineer in the semiconductor industry, specializing in computational lithography. My work involves Python programming to enhance and validate photolithography models and new features. The primary model I work on simulates the entire process from exposure to development, aiming to improve photolithography resolution. This contributes significantly to the advancement of semiconductor manufacturing technology.
<br><br>
In 2020, I graduated with a B.S. in Physics from Shanxi University, where I studied under the guidance of Prof. LI Weidong. Following graduation, I had the opportunity to delve into the molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) growth of Si/Ge nanowires with controlled in-plane orientation. This research was conducted under the supervision of Prof. ZHANG Jianjun from the Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). This July, I earned my Master's degree through a joint program offered by the Southern University of Science and Technology and the Institute of Physics, CAS. Under the guidance of Prof. HE Yu, I dedicated my studies to silicon-based quantum dots, with a primary focus on quantum simulation using STM hydrogen depassivation lithography.

  <summary>Postgraduate Education</summary>
<p>
  <br>
I began my postgraduate studies and research journey in 2021 after achieving the highest score on the admission exam. I was privileged to be part of Group N09 at the renowned Institute of Physics, CAS, where I focused on the growth of in-plane ordered Si/Ge nanowires using molecular beam epitaxy.
<br><br>
In my initial semester of graduate school, I dedicatedly pursued multiple professional courses, achieving an excellent GPA of 3.74. Additionally, I had the opportunity to acquire practical experience in operating STM and MBE combined ultrahigh vacuum systems under the guidance of Prof. Wang Gan from the Southern University of Science and Technology while studying the interfacial superconductivity of iron telluride heterojunctions.
<br><br>
In the subsequent semester, alongside my continued coursework finished with an overall GPA of 3.65, I immersed myself in the STM laboratory dedicated to silicon-based quantum dot quantum computing, where I honed my skills in the fundamental operations of STM hydrogen depassivation lithography for silicon-based samples. It involved every crucial step, ranging from sample degas, flash, H cover preparation, and tip electrochemical etching to STM hydrogen depassivation lithography, dosing, incorporation, and MBE encapsulation. As a member of a research group that evaluates scientific work each semester, I consistently received the highest grade amongst my peers.
<br><br>
At the initial stage of building the experimental system, I actively participated in every aspect, including component installation, troubleshooting, and equipment maintenance. Through numerous rounds of sample replacement, we eventually developed a more advanced processing technology and experimental conditions. However, this journey was challenging. I encountered difficulties such as substrate contamination and the adverse effects of epitaxial conditions on the transport properties of the devices. Each problem required extensive experimentation, comparison, and technical improvements spanning several months or even longer. It was during this process that my experimental thinking and innovation skills were practically exercised and improved. For instance, we emulated and designed some charge deflectors to address the issue of device leakage caused by the partial impact of the high-energy electron beam from the EBVV on the sample. These deflectors effectively redirected the charge away from the target direction, safeguarding the transport properties of the sample.
<br><br>
After the completion of initial exploratory work and the establishment of sound experimental conditions, I embarked on further research focusing on the following subjects to advance scientific understanding in my field:
<ul>
<li> Comparison of the impact from different incorporation and annealing conditions, as well as the presence or absence of a locking layer, on the segregation of P and B and on the conductivity of samples</li>
<li> Realization low-temperature homoepitaxy of silicon, aiming at achieving exceptional surface quality and atomic-level flatness.</li>
<li> Rigorous inspection and comparison of the conductivity and leakage in tunnel junctions with varying gap widths, aiming to optimize the performance of more complex devices.</li>
<li> Exploration single-electron transistors (SETs) with highly steady transport properties.</li>
<li> Studying the properties of single-electron pumps (SEPs) with the transport characteristics of multiple quantum dots.</li>
<li> Advancing the alignment technique of 3D top-electrodes integration, enabling the precise control of energy level for various devices.</li>
<li> Quantum simulation of the dynamic AC-driven SSH model utilizing STM hydrogen depassivation lithography technique.</li>
<li> Experimental realization of the critical phase utilizing silicon quantum dot systems.</li>
</ul>
  
To comprehensively enhance my experimental proficiency, I actively engaged in learning and successfully completed application tests involving various micro-nano machining equipments, such as the step profiler, lithography machine, laser direct writing system, and SEM.
<br><br>
Additionally, alongside my experimental research, I devoted considerable effort to acquiring and honing my skills in Python programming, enabling calculations for simple quantum mechanics problems. For instance, I successfully calculated the energy spectrum of the static SSH model, a significant model for topological insulators, and further elucidated the quasi-energy spectrum and transport properties of the dynamic AC-driven SSH model. Besides, recent works include completing a chapter on the simulation of one-dimensional spin chains using STM technology in the atomic manufacturing textbook edited by Professor Song Fengqi of Nanjing University.

  <summary>Undergraduate Education</summary>
<p>
  <br>
In 2016, I was admitted to the School of Mathematical Sciences at Shanxi University, achieving the highest score in the college entrance examination. As an active class committee member, I diligently organized and participated in various student organizations, community activities, and class events. By fostering a positive, optimistic, united, and friendly class culture, I successfully cultivated collective cohesion and established a conducive academic atmosphere for classmates' studies and daily lives. Consequently, I was honored with the title of "Excellent Student Leader."
<br><br>
In the following year, though ranking 4th out of 198 students in the School of Mathematical Sciences, I decided to switch my major to the School of Physical and Electronic Engineering. Then, under the guidance of Prof. Xiao Liantuan, I embarked on an undergraduate scientific research project titled "Real-time Single Molecule Dynamics Information Extraction Based on Quantum Coherence Modulation and FPGA."
In August 2018, representing our school, I participated in the 9th China Undergraduate Physics Tournament and achieved the third prize. In September 2018, I participated in the 10th Chinese Mathematics Competitions and earned the second prize. In October 2018, I competed in the National Undergraduate Mathematical Contest in Modeling, clinching the second prize as well.
<br><br>
In March 2019, I was privileged to present an oral report entitled "Laser Medical Image Processing based on Neighborhood Concerned Gaussian Mixture Model" at the 14th National Conference on Laser Technology and Optoelectronics (LTO 2019) and the Chinese Optical Ten Progress in 2018. Meanwhile, I published this paper as the first author. In this research, we proposed a novel approach to laser medical image segmentation utilizing the Neighborhood Concerned Gaussian mixture model, addressing its limitations in terms of segmentation accuracy and noise resistance. In July 2019, I participated in the Provincial Competition of the 16th "Challenge Cup" Undergraduate Extracurricular Academic Science and Technology Work Contest for College Students. Presenting my personal project, I was honored to be awarded the grand prize.
<br><br>
Finally, under the meticulous guidance of Prof. Li Weidong, I successfully culminated my undergraduate journey by completing my graduation thesis on the topic of "Theoretical Research on Rabi Oscillation and Rabi Spectrum." My thesis underwent rigorous examination and ultimately garnered recognition as an excellent graduation thesis.

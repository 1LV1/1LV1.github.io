  <summary>Introduction</summary>
<p>
  <br>
As a Product Engineer in the semiconductor industry, I specialize in computational lithography, developing and validating photolithography models and new features using Python. My core work involves simulating the end-to-end process from exposure to development, ensuring high-fidelity pattern transfer and critical dimension control—directly contributing to the advancement of semiconductor manufacturing technology. 
<br><br>
In 2020, I graduated with a B.S. in Optoelectronic Information Science and Engineering from Shanxi University, where I focused on theoretical studies under the guidance of Prof. Weidong Li. Following graduation, I continued my research journey at the Institute of Physics, CAS, where I studied the MBE growth of in-plane Si/Ge nanowires under Prof. Jianjun Zhang. Subsequently, under the supervision of Prof. Yu He, I focused on quantum simulation using silicon-based quantum dots fabricated via STM hydrogen depassivation lithography. I completed my Master’s degree in 2024 through a joint program between the Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech) and the Institute of Physics, CAS.

  <summary>Postgraduate Education</summary>
<p>
  <br>
I began my postgraduate studies and research journey in 2021, having achieved the highest score on the admission exam. I was privileged to be part of Group N09 at the Institute of Physics, CAS, where I focused on the growth of in-plane ordered Si/Ge nanowires using molecular beam epitaxy.
<br><br>
In my initial semester of graduate school, I dedicatedly pursued multiple professional courses, achieving an excellent GPA of 3.74. Meanwhile, I had the opportunity to acquire practical experience in operating an STM and MBE combined ultrahigh vacuum system under the guidance of Prof. Gan Wang from the Southern University of Science and Technology, to study the interfacial superconductivity of iron telluride heterojunctions.
<br><br>
In the subsequent semester, alongside my continued coursework, which resulted in an overall GPA of 3.65, I immersed myself in the STM laboratory dedicated to quantum computing on quantum dot systems in silicon. There, I honed my skills in the fundamental operations of STM hydrogen depassivation lithography. This process involved every crucial step, ranging from sample degas, flash, H cover preparation, and tip electrochemical etching to STM hydrogen depassivation lithography, dosing, incorporation, and MBE encapsulation.
<br><br>
At the initial stage of building the laboratory equipment, I actively participated in every aspect, including component installation, troubleshooting, and equipment maintenance. Through hundreds of sample replacements, we eventually developed more advanced processing technologies and improved experimental conditions. However, this journey was challenging. I encountered difficulties such as substrate contamination and the adverse effects of epitaxial conditions on the transport properties of the devices. Each problem required extensive experimentation, comparison, and technical improvements spanning several months or even longer. It was during this process that my experimental thinking and innovation skills were practically exercised and improved. For instance, we emulated and designed some charge deflectors to address the issue of device leakage caused by high-energy electrons from the EBVV source shooting at the sample. These deflectors effectively redirected the charges away, safeguarding the transport properties of the sample.
<br><br>
After the completion of initial exploratory work and the establishment of sound experimental conditions, I embarked on further research focusing on the following subjects:
<ul>
<li> Investigated the effects of annealing and growth conditions on phosphorus/boron segregation and sample conductivity.</li>
<li> Achieved low-temperature homoepitaxial growth of silicon, resulting in atomically flat, high-quality surfaces.</li>
<li> Explored conductivity and leakage in tunnel junctions across varying gap widths to optimize performance in complex devices.</li>
<li> Studied single-electron transistors (SETs) with highly stable charge transport characteristics.</li>
<li> Investigated single-electron pumps (SEPs) characterized by multi-quantum-dot transport.</li>
<li> Performed quantum simulation of the Su–Schrieffer–Heeger (SSH) model on a platform of tunable quantum dot chains.</li>
<li> Experimentally simulated topologically protected Anderson localization phenomena.</li>
<li> Developed a fabrication process for three-dimensional integrated multi-layer quantum chips.</li>
</ul>
  
To comprehensively enhance my experimental proficiency, I actively engaged in learning and successfully completed application tests involving various micro and nano machining equipment, such as the step profiler, lithography machine, laser direct writing system, and SEM.
<br><br>
Additionally, alongside my experimental research, I devoted effort to acquiring and honing my skills in Python programming for solving simple quantum mechanics problems. For instance, I calculated the energy spectrum of the static SSH model, a significant model for topological insulators, and further derived the quasi-energy spectrum and transport properties of the dynamic AC-driven SSH model. Besides, I compiled a chapter on the simulation of one-dimensional spin chains using STM technology for the atomic manufacturing textbook, edited by Prof. Fengqi Song of Nanjing University, in 2023.
<br><br>
Finally, I was honored with the titles of "Outstanding Graduate Student" and "Outstanding Graduating Graduate Student" by SUStech, and I obtained my master's degree in 2024.

  <summary>Undergraduate Education</summary>
<p>
  <br>
In 2016, I was admitted to the School of Mathematical Sciences at Shanxi University, achieving the highest score in the college entrance examination. As a class committee member, I diligently organized and participated in various student organizations, community activities, and class events. By fostering a positive, optimistic, united, and friendly class culture, I successfully cultivated collective cohesion and established a conducive academic atmosphere for classmates' studies and daily lives. Consequently, I was honored with the title of "Excellent Student Leader".
<br><br>
In the following year, though ranking 4th out of 198 students in the School of Mathematical Sciences, I decided to switch my major to the School of Physical and Electronic Engineering. Then, under the guidance of Prof. Liantuan Xiao, I embarked on an undergraduate scientific research project titled "Real-time Extraction of Single Molecule Dynamics Information Based on Quantum Coherence Modulation and FPGA".
In August 2018, representing our university, I participated in the 9th China Undergraduate Physics Tournament and achieved the third prize. In September 2018, I participated in the 10th Chinese Mathematics Competitions and earned the second prize. In October 2018, I competed in the National Undergraduate Mathematical Contest in Modeling, clinching the second prize as well.
<br><br>
In March 2019, I presented an oral report titled "Laser Medical Image Processing Based on Neighborhood Concerned Gaussian Mixture Model" at the 14th National Conference on Laser Technology and Optoelectronics (LTO 2019) and the Chinese Optical Ten Progress in 2018. Meanwhile, I published this paper as the first author. In this research, we proposed the Neighborhood Concerned Gaussian mixture model to segment laser medical images, addressing the limitations in terms of segmentation accuracy and noise immunity. In July 2019, I participated in the Provincial Competition of the 16th "Challenge Cup" Undergraduate Extracurricular Academic Science and Technology Work Contest for College Students, where my individual project was awarded the grand prize.
<br><br>
Finally, under the meticulous guidance of Prof. Weidong Li, I successfully culminated my undergraduate journey by completing my graduation thesis on the topic of "Theoretical Research on Rabi Oscillation and Rabi Spectrum". My thesis underwent rigorous examination and ultimately garnered the title of "Excellent Graduation Thesis".

I am a 24th master's degree student engaged in a joint program between Southern University of Science and Technology and Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Under the guidance of PI He Yu, I have dedicated my studies to silicon-based quantum dots, primarily focused on related research utilizing STM hydrogen lithography. 

I completed my undergraduate studies in the Department of Physics at Shanxi University, where I was mentored by Prof. Li Weidong. After my graduation, I had the opportunity to study the molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) growth of controlled in-plane Si/Ge nanowires, under the guidance of PI Zhang Jianjun from the Institute of Physics, CAS. Building upon this foundation, I continued my academic journey at the Southern University of Science and Technology, delving into the realm of quantum simulation based on STM hydrogen lithography, under the mentorship of PI He Yu. At present, my research focus revolves around the quantum simulation of the multi-body Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, a topic that continues to captivate my intellectual curiosity.

In 2021, I embarked on my postgraduate study and research journey, having achieved the top score in the examination for admission. I was privileged to be part of Group N09 at the renowned Institute of Physic, CAS, where I focused on the growth of in-plane ordered Si/Ge nanowires using molecular beam epitaxy.

During my first semester in graduate school, I diligently pursued a wide range of professional courses, resulting in a commendable GPA of 3.74. Additionally, I had the opportunity to acquire valuable hands-on experience in operating STM and MBE combined ultrahigh vacuum systems under the guidance of Prof. Wang Gan from the Southern University of Science and Technology while studying the interfacial superconductivity of iron telluride heterojunctions.

In the subsequent semester, alongside my continued coursework finished with an overall GPA of 3.65, I immersed myself in the STM laboratory dedicated to silicon-based quantum dot quantum computing. Here, I honed my skills in the fundamental operations of STM hydrogen lithography for silicon-based samples. This involved every crucial step, ranging from sample degas, flash, H cover preparation and tip electrochemical etching to STM hydrogen lithography, dosing, incorporation, and MBE encapsulation. In a research group that grades scientific research work every semester, I have been the only student who got the best grade every time.

At the initial stage of the platform construction, I actively participated in every aspect, including component installation, troubleshooting, and equipment maintenance. Through numerous rounds of sample iteration, we eventually developed a more advanced processing technology and experimental conditions. However, this journey was not without its challenges. I encountered difficulties such as substrate contamination and the adverse effects of epitaxial conditions on the transport properties of the devices. Each problem required extensive experimentation, comparison, and technical improvements spanning several months or even longer. It was during this process that my experimental thinking and innovation skills were truly put to the test. For instance, to address the issue of device leakage caused by the partial impact of the high-energy electron beam from the EBVV on the sample, we emulated and designed some charge deflectors. These deflectors effectively redirected the charge away from the target direction, safeguarding the transport properties of the sample.

After the completion of initial exploratory work and the establishment of sound experimental conditions, I embarked on further research focusing on the following subjects to advance scientific understanding in my field:

  * Comparing the impact of different incorporation and annealing conditions, as well as the presence or absence of a locking layer, on the segregation of P and B and the conductivity of samples.

  * Realizing low-temperature homoepitaxy of silicon, aiming at achieving exceptional surface quality and atomic-level flatness.

  * Conducting thorough verification of conductivity and leakage in tunnel junctions with varying gap widths, aiming at optimizing the performance of more sophisticated devices.

  * Exploring a single electron transistor with highly steady transport properties.

  * Investigating the properties of a single electron pump with multi-quantum dot transport characteristics.

  * Advancing the integration of 3D top electrode alignment techniques, enabling precise energy level control for various devices.

  * Quantum simulation of the SSH model utilizing STM hydrogen lithography technology.

  * Realization experimentally of the critical phase utilizing the silicon-based quantum dot system.

To comprehensively enhance my experimental proficiency, I actively engaged in learning and successfully completed application tests involving various micro and nano machineries, such as the step profiler, lithography machine, laser direct writing, and SEM, at the micro and nano machining center.

Additionally, alongside my experimental research, I devoted considerable effort to acquiring and honing my skills in Python programming, enabling calculations for simple quantum mechanics problems. For instance, I successfully calculated the energy spectrum of the static SSH model, a significant model for topological insulators, and further elucidated the quasi-energy spectrum and transport properties of the dynamic AC-driven SSH model. Recent works also include the completion of a chapter on the simulation of one-dimensional spin chains using STM technology in the atomic manufacturing textbook edited by Professor Song Fengqi of Nanjing University. 

In 2016, I was admitted to the School of Mathematical Sciences at Shanxi University, achieving the highest score in the college entrance examination. As an active member of the class committee, I diligently organized and participated in various student organizations, community activities, and class events. By fostering a positive, optimistic, united, and friendly class culture, I successfully cultivated collective cohesion and established a conducive academic atmosphere for classmates' study and daily lives. Consequently, I was honored with the title of "Excellent Student Leader."

In the following year, though ranking 4th out of 198 students in the School of Mathematical Sciences, I decided to switch my major to the School of Physical and Electronic Engineering. Then, under the guidance of Prof. Xiao Liantuan, I embarked on an undergraduate scientific research project titled "Real-time Single Molecule Dynamics Information Extraction based on Quantum Coherence Modulation and FPGA."
In August 2018, representing our school I participated in the 9th China Undergraduate Physics Tournament and I achieved the third prize. In September 2018, I participated in the 10th Chinese Mathematics Competitions and earned the second prize. In October 2018, I competed in the National Undergraduate Mathematical Contest in Modeling, clinching the second prize as well.

In March 2019, I had the privilege to present an oral report entitled "Laser Medical Image Processing based on Neighborhood Concerned Gaussian Mixture Model" at the 14th National Laser Technology and Optoelectronics Academic Conference and the 2018 China Optics Ten Progress Conference. Meanwhile, I published this paper as the first author. In this research, we proposed a novel approach to laser medical image segmentation utilizing the Neighborhood Concerned Gaussian mixture model, addressing its limitations in terms of segmentation accuracy and noise resistance.

In July 2019, I participated in the Provincial Competition of the 16th "Challenge Cup" Undergraduate Extracurricular Academic Science and Technology Work Contest for College Students. Presenting my personal project, I was honored to be awarded the grand prize.

Finally, under the meticulous guidance of Prof. Li Weidong, I successfully culminated my undergraduate journey by completing my graduation thesis on the topic of "Theoretical Research on Rabi Oscillation and Rabi Spectrum." My thesis underwent rigorous examination and ultimately garnered recognition as an excellent graduation thesis.

"The road ahead is long, as I diligently explore every avenue." Having just embarked on the path of scientific research, I am prepared to face both the smooth and arduous obstacles that lie ahead. Throughout this journey, I will forever cherish the enthusiasm of my youth and the fervor in pursuing my ideals. Aiming high, yet firmly grounded, I remain committed to charting my future course.

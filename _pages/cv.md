Research experience
======
* 2021-now: 
  * Advisor: He Yu
  * Institute of Quantum Science and Engineering, Southern University of Science and Technology
  * STM Laboratory of silicon-based quantum dot Quantum Computing research group
  * The current research project is the quantum simulation of a multibody SSH model based on STM hydrogen depassivation lithography. The completed topics include single electron transistors with stable transport properties, single electron pump with multi-quantum dot transport characteristics, integrating 3D top electrode alignment techniques, etc. I have participated in the whole process from platform construction to maturity, being familiar with STM and MBE combined ultra-high vacuum systems.

* 2021: 
  * Advisor: Zhang Jianjun
  * Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences
  * N09 research group
  * The molecular beam epitaxy of Group IV elements is studied. The main research topic is to realize the controlled in-plane ordered Si/Ge nanowires epitaxial growth utilizing groove etching.
 
* 2020:
  * Advisor: Li Weidong
  * Institute of theoretical physics, Shanxi University

I am a product engineer in the semiconductor industry, currently occupied with Python programming for lithography models, which simulate the exposure to development process, contributing to the enhancement of photolithography resolution.

I completed my Master's degree in physics in June this year, as part of a joint program between [Southern University of Science and Technology](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/) and [Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://english.iop.cas.cn/). 

Advised by Prof. [HE Yu](https://sustech.edu.cn/zh/faculties/heyu.html) from the Institute for Quantum Science and Engineering, SUSTech, I have dedicated my studies to the quantum simulation, primarily focused on quantum dots in silicon using scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM). 

Advised by Prof. [ZHANG Jianjun](http://edu.iphy.ac.cn/moreintro.php?id=2212) from the Institute of Physics, CAS, I had the opportunity to study the molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) growth of controlled in-plane Si/Ge nanowires.

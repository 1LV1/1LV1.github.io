I am an product engineer in semiconductor industry currently, occupied in Python programming for lithography model.

I recently completed my Master's degree in physics in July this year, as part of a joint program between [Southern University of Science and Technology](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/) and [Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://english.iop.cas.cn/). 

Advised by PI [He Yu](https://sustech.edu.cn/zh/faculties/heyu.html) from the Institute for Quantum Science and Engineering, Sustech, I have dedicated my studies to silicon-based quantum dots, primarily focused on quantum simulation utilizing scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Advised by PI [Zhang Jianjun](http://edu.iphy.ac.cn/moreintro.php?id=2212) from the Institute of Physics, CAS, I had the opportunity to study the molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) growth of controlled in-plane Si/Ge nanowires.


Research Interests
======

Quantum Simulation: Anderson localization, critical phase, Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model...

Laboratory Equipment: Variable and low-temperature STM ultrahigh vacuum systems combined with MBE.

I am a Product Engineer in the semiconductor industry, currently working on Python programming for lithography models that simulate the exposure-to-development process to ensure high-fidelity pattern transfer and critical dimension control.

I hold a Master's degree in Physics from a joint program between [the Southern University of Science and Technology](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/) and [the Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://english.iop.cas.cn/).

Under the advisory of Prof. [Yu He](https://sustech.edu.cn/zh/faculties/heyu.html) at the SUSTech Institute for Quantum Science and Engineering, my research is dedicated to quantum simulation, specializing in silicon-based quantum dot devices engineered through scanning tunneling microscopy (STM).

Under the supervision of Prof. [Jianjun Zhang](http://edu.iphy.ac.cn/moreintro.php?id=2212) at the Institute of Physics, CAS, I focused on the molecular beam epitaxial (MBE) growth of controlled in-plane Si/Ge nanowires.
